# 🩸 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to predict whether a person is diabetic or not using various health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin levels.  
It applies **data preprocessing, feature scaling, and multiple machine learning models** to identify the best-performing one.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KMeans)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and replacing zeros with NaN.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing correlations, distributions, and outliers.  
3. **Feature Scaling:** Standardizing data for better model performance.  
4. **Model Building:**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - KMeans Clustering  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC score, and confusion matrix.
